== Summary

This package contains the dependencies needed to build oVirt JavaScript
applications.  By using this package, a project can use nodejs dependencies
and build without downloading packages.

== Usage

Modify your build script and/or CI job configuration to ensure this
packages is installed when building your project:

* `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules`

It's highly recommended to specify an explicit version and release when
requiring the `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules` package in your project.  For
example, in your `rpm.spec` file:

  BuildRequires: ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules >= 2.1.6-1

Note that `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules` requires `nodejs` and takes care of
installing the `yarn` package manager.

== Build script

In your build script, source `setup-env.sh` to set up the Node.js environment
and run `yarn install` to populate the `./node_modules` directory:

  cd /path/to/your/project
  source /usr/share/ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules/setup-env.sh

The setup script runs `yarn install` in offline mode, using JavaScript
package sources located at:

  /usr/share/ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules/yarn-offline-cache

If the `setup-env.sh` command fails, it usually means that you need to add a
link:pre-seed/README.adoc[pre-seed] to or rebuild the `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules`
RPM so its offline cache directory will be updated to contains all dependencies currently
required by your project.

== Using this package in a project

Simply modify the `projects.list` file, adding URL(s) referencing your
project's `package.json` file and the associated `yarn.lock` file.

Both `package.json` and `yarn.lock` are mandatory in the target project. The build
will fail if any of those files are not available.

== Package versioning

When changing the `projects.list` file, bump `.y` in `Version` and reset
the `Release` number.

When rebuilding the package to reflect changes in the consuming projects
(the ones listed in the `projects.list` file), or when adding a pre-seed,
bump `.z` in `Version` and reset the `Release` number.

For packaging related changes, simply bump the `Release` number.

== Pre-seed

If you need dependencies to build a patch or pull request where changes to
`package.json` or `yarn.lock` are not yet merged, you can add a manual pre-seed.
The avoids a chicken and egg problem.

=== Summary

If you need dependencies to exist in ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules, but
your `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files are not yet committed, you can
pre-seed ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules with your files to avoid a
chicken and egg problem.

Add a subdirectory to this pre-seed directory, and in that subdirectory
add copies of the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` your new project or patch
is using.

The name of the subdirectory needs to be `<project>_<pr>` or
`<project>_<changeid>`. The github PR or gerrit ChangeId needs to be
valid and open. This is verified by `automation/check.sh.`

**NOTE: Pre-seeds for merged or abandoned patches must be removed from pre-seed directory.**
The check CI script will only pass if all pre-seeds are linked to an open patch or pull
request.

=== For example

Files needed for pre-seeings a gerrit patch `I42c223e8bc7c9087c29370e6db8524ab21d51c36`:

  - pre-seed/cockpit-ovirt_I42c223e8bc7c9087c29370e6db8524ab21d51c36/package.json
  - pre-seed/cockpit-ovirt_I42c223e8bc7c9087c29370e6db8524ab21d51c36/yarn.lock


Files needs for pre-seeding a GitHub pull request `42`:

  - pre-seed/example-project_42/package.json
  - pre-seed/example-project_42/yarn.lock


After committing a patch that adds a pre-seed, the newly built version
of ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules will now be pre-seeded with your
new `package.json` and `yarn.lock` requirements.

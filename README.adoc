== Summary

This package contains the dependencies needed to build oVirt JavaScript
applications.  By using this package, a project can use nodejs dependencies
and build without downloading packages.

== Usage

Modify your build script and/or CI job configuration to ensure this
packages is installed when building your project:

* `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules`

It's highly recommended to specify an explicit version and release when
requiring the `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules` package in your project.  For
example, in your `rpm.spec` file:

  BuildRequires: ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules >= 2.3.0-1

Note that `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules` requires `nodejs` and takes care of
installing the `yarn` package manager.

== Build script

In your build script, source `setup-env.sh` to set up the Node.js environment
and run `yarn install` to populate the `./node_modules` directory:

  cd /path/to/your/project
  source /usr/share/ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules/setup-env.sh

The setup script runs `yarn install` in offline mode, using JavaScript
package sources located at:

  /usr/share/ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules/yarn-offline-cache

If the `setup-env.sh` command fails, it usually means that you need to add a
<<pre-seed,pre-seed>> and rebuild the `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules` RPM so
the offline cache directory will be updated to contains all dependencies currently
required by your project or pull request.

== Using this package in a project

Simply modify the `projects.list.mjs` JavaScript file, adding the project's git information.
The git repository will be fetched to access the project's `package.json` and `yarn.lock`
file.

Both `package.json` and `yarn.lock` are mandatory in the target project. The build
will fail if any of those files are not available.

For example, in the `projects` section of `projects.list.mjs`, the following block
references a git repo, branch (any commitish will work) and folder to be included in
the package:

```js
    'ovirt-web-ui': {
      git_url: 'https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-web-ui.git',
      branch: 'master',
      folder: '/',
    },
```

== Package versioning

The project is version is the standard `x.y.z-release` format. In general, only bump the
`x` number for major project changes.

When adding a project to the `projects.list.mjs` file, bump `.y` in `Version`
and reset the `Release` number.

When rebuilding the package to pickup changes in the projects listed in the
`projects.list.mjs` file, bump `.z` in `Version` and reset the `Release` number.

When adding a pre-seed source to the `pre-seeds.list.mjs` file, bump `.y` in `Version`
and reset the `Release` number.

When adding or removing a specific pull request pre-seed, bump `.z` in `Version` and
reset the `Release` number.

Bump the `Release` number for a rebuild with the same project and pre-seed configurations.

== Pre-seed [[pre-seed]]

If you need dependencies to build a pull request where changes to `package.json` or
`yarn.lock` are not yet merged, you can add a manual pre-seed based on a GitHub pull
request.  This avoids a chicken and egg problem.

=== Summary

Adding a pre-seed is as easy as adding a reference to a pull request with the `package.json`
and/or `yarn.lock` changes.

The check CI script will only pass if all pre-seeds are linked to an open pull request.

**NOTE: Pre-seeds for merged or closed pull-requests patches must be removed for CI to pass.**

=== For example

To pre-seed from a GitHub pull request `42` against the `oVirt/ovirt-web-ui` project,
update the `pre-seeds.list.mjs` file to look like:

```js
    'ovirt-web-ui': {
      github: {
        owner: 'oVirt',
        repo: 'ovirt-web-ui'
      },
      folder: '/',
      pr: [
        42,
      ]
    },
```

Any number of project and PRs per project can be listed.

After a pull request adding a pre-seed is merged, the newly built version
of `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules` will now be pre-seeded with the new `package.json`
and `yarn.lock` requirements.  Offline CI builds of the source pre-seed will now
work.

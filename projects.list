# This file contains URLs, each one referencing a "package.json"
# file and the associated "yarn.lock" file for the given project.

# Each URL should contain the "{FILE}" placeholder, for example:
#
#   https://example.com/your-project/{FILE}
#
# The build script substitutes the placeholder with specific file
# name, for example:
#
#   https://example.com/your-project/package.json
#   https://example.com/your-project/yarn.lock
#
# Blank lines and lines starting with "#" character are skipped.
